  - []: empty array
  - 24: integer
  - 'hello': string
  - true: boolean

3. []

- number of elements: 0

4. [['romeo', 'juliet'], false]

- number of elements: 2
  - ['romeo', 'juliet'] : array
  - false: boolean

5. [{name: 'bob', age: 23}, {name: 'paul', age: 33}]

- number of elements: 2
  - {name: 'bob', age: 23}: object
  - {name: 'paul', age: 33}: object

## Question 7: What is the type and value for each of the following variables?

1. let name = 'bob';

- type: string
- value: 'bob'

2. let age = 45;

- type: int
- value: 45

3. let isMarried = false;

- type: boolean
- value: false

4. let person = { name: name, age: age, isMarried: isMarried }

// Assuming name, age and isMarried are variables with assigned values

- type: object
- value: { name: name, age: age, isMarried: isMarried }

5. let kids = [{name: 'Morty', age: 3}, {name: 'Summer', age: 7}]

- type: array
- value: [{name: 'Morty', age: 3}, {name: 'Summer', age: 7}]

## Question 8: Use string interpolation instead of concatenation

1.

```js
const name = 'Jack';
const greeting = 'Hi';

console.log(`${greeting} ${name}!`);
```

2.

```js
const person1 = { name: 'Mabel', age: 102 };
const person2 = { name: 'Doug', age: 104 };

console.log(
  `${person1.name} and ${person2.name} are the oldest people I know. Together, they have lived for ${person1.age + person2.age} years!`
);
```

3.

```js
let str = 'Hi Kiddo!';
const temperature = 5;

if (temperature < 0) {
  str = `${str} It's very cold outside, you better wear a coat!`;
} else {
  str = `${str} It's beautiful outside, let's go swimming!`;
}
```
